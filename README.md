## Introduction

A Github Action to securely store Terraform plan files in a cloud storage (S3 or Azure Blob Storage)  with metadata
storage in cloud document database (DynamoDB or CosmosDB). This is useful in CI/CD pipelines where you want to store
the plan files when a feature branch is opened and applied when merged.



## Usage




## AWS (default)

```yaml
 - name: Store Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v1
    id: store-plan
    with:
      action: storePlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      tableName: acme-terraform-plan-metadata
      bucketName: acme-terraform-plans

 - name: Get Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v1
    id: get-plan
    with:
      action: getPlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      tableName: acme-terraform-plan-metadata
      bucketName: acme-terraform-plans
```

## Azure

```yaml
 - name: Store Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v1
    id: store-plan
    with:
      metadataRepositoryType: cosmos
      planRepositoryType: azureblob
      action: storePlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      blobAccountName: tfplans
      blobContainerName: plans
      cosmosContainerName: terraform-plan-storage
      cosmosDatabaseName: terraform-plan-storage
      cosmosEndpoint: "https://my-cosmo-account.documents.azure.com:443/"

 - name: Get Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v1
    id: get-plan
    with:
      metadataRepositoryType: cosmos
      planRepositoryType: azureblob
      action: getPlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      blobAccountName: tfplans
      blobContainerName: plans
      cosmosContainerName: terraform-plan-storage
      cosmosDatabaseName: terraform-plan-storage
      cosmosEndpoint: "https://my-cosmo-account.documents.azure.com:443/"
```
