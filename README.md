## Introduction

A Github Action to securely store Terraform plan files in a cloud storage (S3 or Azure Blob Storage)  with metadata
storage in cloud document database (DynamoDB or CosmosDB). This is useful in CI/CD pipelines where you want to store
the plan files when a feature branch is opened and applied when merged.




## Usage


## AWS (default)

Standard usage for this action is with AWS. In AWS, we store Terraform plan files in a S3 Bucket and store metadata in DynamoDB. Specify the DynamoDB table name and S3 bucket name with `tableName` and `bucketName` respectively.

The filepath in S3 and the attributes in DynamoDB will use the given `component` and `stack` values to update or create a unique target for each Terraform plan file.

The plan file itself is pulled from or writen to a local file path. Set this with `planPath`.

Finally, choose whether to store the plan file or retrieve an existing plan file. To create or update a plan file, set `action` to `storePlan`. To pull an existing plan file, set `action` to `getPlan`.

```yaml
 - name: Store Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v1
    id: store-plan
    with:
      action: storePlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      tableName: acme-terraform-plan-metadata
      bucketName: acme-terraform-plans

 - name: Get Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v1
    id: get-plan
    with:
      action: getPlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      tableName: acme-terraform-plan-metadata
      bucketName: acme-terraform-plans
```

## Azure

This action also supports Azure. In Azure, we store Terraform plan files with Blob Storage and store metadata in Cosmos DB.

To use the Azure implementation rather than the default AWS implementation, specify `planRepositoryType` as `azureblob` and `metadataRepositoryType` as `cosmos`. Then pass the Blob Account and Container names with `blobAccountName` and `blobContainerName` and the Cosmos Container name, Database name, and Endpoint with `cosmosContainerName`, `cosmosDatabaseName`, and `cosmosEndpoint`.

Again set the `component`, `stack`, `planPath`, and `action` in the same manner as AWS above.

```yaml
 - name: Store Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v1
    id: store-plan
    with:
      action: storePlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      planRepositoryType: azureblob
      blobAccountName: tfplans
      blobContainerName: plans
      metadataRepositoryType: cosmos
      cosmosContainerName: terraform-plan-storage
      cosmosDatabaseName: terraform-plan-storage
      cosmosEndpoint: "https://my-cosmo-account.documents.azure.com:443/"

 - name: Get Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v1
    id: get-plan
    with:
      action: getPlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      planRepositoryType: azureblob
      blobAccountName: tfplans
      blobContainerName: plans
      metadataRepositoryType: cosmos
      cosmosContainerName: terraform-plan-storage
      cosmosDatabaseName: terraform-plan-storage
      cosmosEndpoint: "https://my-cosmo-account.documents.azure.com:443/"
```

## Google Cloud

This action supports Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In GCP, we store Terraform plan files in Google Cloud Storage and metadata in Firestore.

To use the GCP implementation, specify `planRepositoryType` as `gcs` and `metadataRepositoryType` as `firestore`, then provide the following GCP-specific settings: `googleProjectId` to specify the project for both GCS bucket and Firestore, `bucketName` for GCS storage, and `googleFirestoreDatabaseName`/`googleFirestoreCollectionName` for Firestore metadata.

The `component`, `stack`, `planPath`, and `action` parameters work the same way as in AWS and Azure examples.

```yaml
 - name: Store Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v2
    id: store-plan
    with:
      action: storePlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      planRepositoryType: gcs
      metadataRepositoryType: firestore
      bucketName: my-terraform-plans
      gcpProjectId: my-gcp-project
      gcpFirestoreDatabaseName: terraform-plan-metadata
      gcpFirestoreCollectionName: terraform-plan-storage

 - name: Get Plan
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage@v2
    id: get-plan
    with:
      action: getPlan
      planPath: my-plan.tfplan
      component: mycomponent
      stack: core-mycomponent-use1
      planRepositoryType: gcs
      metadataRepositoryType: firestore
      bucketName: my-terraform-plans
      gcpProjectId: my-gcp-project
      gcpFirestoreDatabaseName: terraform-plan-metadata
      gcpFirestoreCollectionName: terraform-plan-storage
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
